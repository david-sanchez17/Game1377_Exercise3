/*
 * Assignment: Asteroids Game - Asteroid Script - PART 2
 * 
 * Objective: Create a functional asteroid script. This script will be responsible for the functionality of the asteroids.
 * this should include initial velocity, angular velocity, and breaking into smaller asteroids when destroyed.
 * Remember, asteroids should only spawn through the AsteroidSpawner script. 
 
* Requirements:
* 1. The asteroid should start with a constant speed but a random angular velocity. Both of these are set in the Rigidbody2D
*       The movement direction of the asteroid should not change. 
*       Hint: All movement for the asteroid should be done via a Rigidbody2D and should be able to be set at Start.
* 2. When the asteroid is destroyed, it should spawn two smaller asteroids if it is not already the smallest size. 
*       Hint: How can you use a function to set the AsteroidSpawner variable from a different script?
* 3. When the astroid hits the player, it should destroy the player.
